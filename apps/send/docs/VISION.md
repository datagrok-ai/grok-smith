# SEND Analysis App

## Purpose
Provide scientists with a modern interface for uploading, exploring, and analyzing
animal study data in CDISC SEND format. Replace manual SAS-based workflows with
an interactive browser-based application integrated into Datagrok.

## Users
- Toxicologists reviewing study results
- Biostatisticians analyzing dose-response relationships
- Study directors overseeing nonclinical programs
- Regulatory affairs preparing submission packages

## Key Capabilities (planned)
- Upload SEND datasets (XPT files or CSV exports)
- Browse studies, subjects, and domains in a structured UI
- Cross-domain analysis (e.g., correlate body weight with lab findings)
- Visualize findings with Datagrok's charting capabilities
- Flag anomalies and generate summary reports
- Export analysis results for regulatory submissions

## Out of Scope (for now)
- SEND dataset creation/authoring (we consume existing SEND data)
- Direct integration with study management systems (LIMS, etc.)
- GLP compliance validation (future phase)
